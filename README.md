# ODIN -Dashboard
This repo houses my implementation of the project "Dashboard".

This is be a rebuild of the file provided by TOP, but redesigned as a dashboard for a guitar learning website "GuitarHeaven".

## What I learned 
- Chrome DevTools are invaluable when using flexbox and CSS grid to layout your page
- Using GitHub Projects and a Kanban-style board to manage my to-do list gives me a better overall picture and improves my workflow
- Progress-elements are difficult to style...
- 

## What I want to do in the future
- Find a better way to use SVGs without them cluttering up my HTML file, but still be able to be styled from CSS.

## What I struggled with
- aligning menu icons with their text
- I'm still not happy with the display-size of my page; everything looks too big. Switching between an ultrawide monitor and laptop screen is confusing me
